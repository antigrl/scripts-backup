==============

Collection of useful bash scripts
<ul>
  <li>image-processing = Removes file like pesky thumbs.db</li>
  <li>move_files = Create directories named after main image in product image group then moves all the images into that dir</li>
  <li>rename.sh = Uses ImageMagik to resize then rename images in a group</li>
</ul>

- [ ] Need to combine some of these into a process for the photographer to run
